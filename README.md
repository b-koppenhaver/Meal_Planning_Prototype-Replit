# Meal_Planning_Prototype-Replit
Problem: Meal planning and creating a weekly grocery list is a tedious task
Solution: Build a weekly meal planning dashboard with a grocery list
    Meal ingredients should be associated to specific stores, ranked by the preference of store they can be purchased at
    Diversify meal options by cuisine and base starch (i.e. rice, pasta, potatoes, bread)
    Regularly schedule meals that yield leftovers
    Minimize the number of stores that ingredients come from
    Allow the ability to add meals which automatically updates the shopping list with the associated ingredients
    Include at least 1 meal per week using all non-perishable ingredients to accommodate unexpected schedule changes
